## Description

Discord is one of the best communication platforms for organizations. Medusa is a leading open-source eCommerce platform. Combining both of them to send Order Notification from Medusa to Discord server using the webhook.  
I have implemented Discord as the notification provider with the event `order.placed`.

## Preview
